  I wouldn't say "broken per se" but more of just a   molecule. No organism yet. 

  Gotcha, so more like unfinished. 

  Right. 

  Awesome, so that should center afterwards then. Yeet. Until then I was able to load in the WhoWeAre and logoTitle, but the entire thing is just in test.html Alright.

  (I figured out what you meant. I'm a dumbass haha)
  The h1 didn't have "WeAre" at first, so that's all I edited.

  Did you want to split the left and right sections into individual molecules? 
      
  I haven't gotten to that yet, so I haven't really thought of it. 
      
  Gotcha, so what do you need me to work on?
  
  Well, when I started testing the molecule, nothing seemed to appear.
       
  Ig next would be to get organisms to work when I get this working
      
  Alright well, I'm going back to work.

  Ill get started pulling in the black sections for LineageOS Manager and NutriCalc.

  Alright, template.html wasn't working at first. Got it going now. Molecule works fine. I'll start on the organism now. I sent you a pic on signal btw

  Not too sure how you want to handle the classes for the `p` and `img` for these two. Mobile size automatically centers the `img`. the `h1` centers because of it's declaration in "static.css". However; the `img` doesn't have a specified style.

  Well, the p would be an atom. There you would put stuff like the font and such for the p atom. The img would then again be an atom. There you'd put things to keep it sized properly and such. The combination of the two (img and p atoms) would ofc be a molecule. There you put things for aranging like p-left, p-right, mobile, desktop, etc. Those would have a media query for only desktop screens and mobile. That row/flex container stuff is all molecule level. I would then put all the rows stack on top together in a single organism, tile1.html probably. Idk what else to put. So when the row collapses for mobile, it is still seen as a div and the page is still told to stack on top of the other rows.

  How can I call the same file twice? Or does that need to be created as an organism? (projectShowcase.html)

  Wdu think of doing gradients like <a href="http://hashicorp.com">this</a>. I found a way to make gradients easily on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16589519/use-css-gradient-over-background-image">stackexchange</a>. I'm thinking about including some of <a href="http://beeple-crap.com/">beeple's stuff</a> as backgrounds but with an overlayed gradient for each tile. Maybe some of the <a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays">everydays</a> and the <a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/vjloops">vj loops</a>. We could even cycle through a number of these depending on what it is. That would be an easy trick in the backend. I also updated the VE logo and changed some stuff around in the project section. I also have an idea for a subsidiaries, solutions, partners and clients, and the footer sections. I'll have to let you know my idea later over the phone.
